/** MedRight will assist in keeping track of medicinal regiments; both for keeping the medicinal schedule as
prescribed, as well as re-ordering those medications/supplements required by the regimen.

MedRight has been designed with ease-of-use and a clear user interface as the top priorities. As a result, the GUI is
 limited to only displaying what is absolutely necessary for the current operation. This in no way limits its
 functionality or usefulness. On the contrary, providing a clear, easy-to-use interface reduces errors and provides a
 clean display of associated information. The underlying structure of the application maintains every aspect of the
 regimen as a whole and provides user prompts in a focused and timely fashion designed toward compliance with the
 regimen.

Within the scope of this application, a treatment is defined as:
 Medical care given by a doctor, to a patient, for an illness or injury.

Medical care can range from prescriptions for pills/liquids, to vitamin/mineral supplements, to topical
 applications (such as ointments, lotions and creams, etc.), as well as referrals to other health care providers.

MedRight assists in all cases where a prescription has been issued by the doctor. It can also be very useful to those
 who just wish to keep track of their own, particular vitamin/supplement regimen.

/* The overall processing of this application will be to:
For each treatment to be entered by the user: (add treatment button?)
1. Display the data entry GUI
2. Prompt user to specify the type of medication (pill, liquid or topical)
3. Instantiate an object from the correct class based upon user input
4. Have user fill out all fields that are delineated as variables in that classes object
5. Initialize the variables based upon user input
6. Have user decide on the creation of calendar events and pop-up reminder notifications
7. Run the methods to fill in the remaining variables
8. Write all object data to a file
9. Repeat until user is finished inputting treatments
10. Allow user interaction through GUI to view various presentations of the data gathered through a display info GUI.
