 * This class is created to provide a systematic way of assigning a
 * unique identifier for each schedule entered. Since using the Name
 * variable in the Schedule objects could become unwieldy --
 * especially with medicinal names potentially misspelled.
 * Using a unique integer identifier is a better choice.
 * The unique identifier is tied to the type of schedule (pill,
 * liquid, topical or fitness) that the user desires to create.
 *
 * The arrays hold values consistent with the type of schedule being
 * entered; with each being assigned a specific block of integers.
