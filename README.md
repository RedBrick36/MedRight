#MedRight
MedRight will assist in keeping track of medicinal regimens; both for keeping the medicinal schedule as
prescribed, as well as timely re-ordering the medications/supplements required by the regimen.

MedRight has been designed with ease-of-use and a clean user interface as the top priorities. As a result, the GUI is
 limited to only displaying what is absolutely necessary for the current operation. This in no way limits its
 functionality or usefulness. On the contrary, providing a clear, easy-to-use interface reduces errors and provides a
 clean display of associated information. The underlying structure of the application maintains every aspect of the
 regimen as a whole and provides user prompts in a focused and timely fashion designed toward compliance with the
 regimen.

Within the scope of this application, a treatment is defined as:
 Medical care given by a doctor, to a patient, for an illness or injury.

Medical care can range from prescriptions for pills/liquids, to vitamin/mineral supplements, to topical
 applications (such as ointments, lotions and creams, etc.), as well as referrals to other health care providers.

MedRight assists in all cases where a prescription has been issued by the doctor. It can also be very useful to those
 who just wish to keep track of their own, particular vitamin/supplement regimen.
